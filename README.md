### First Demo

https://itnext.io/understanding-the-react-context-api-through-building-a-shared-snackbar-for-in-app-notifications-6c199446b80c
Context API has provider and consumer components. Provider provides the state of the snackbar, as well as functions for manipulating that state, to all consumers.

This "SharedSnackbar" demo is written with outdated <em>class<em> syntax and has a weird circular dependency in it, but other than that it's pretty good.

### Second Demo

The second demo is not a complete working demo but fills in the gaps on how to use CreateContext. Pairs well with the first demo.
